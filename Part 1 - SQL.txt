_ Part 1:
  Question 1:
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching.
The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

/* Query 1 - Part 1 */
SELECT
  f.title, c.name,
  COUNT(r.rental_id)
FROM film_category fc
JOIN category c
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN inventory i
ON i.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN rental r
ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP BY f.title, c.name
ORDER BY c.name, f.title ASC;

  Question 2:
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that
all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter,
third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories?

Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

/* Query 2 - Part 1 */
SELECT
  f.title, c.name, f.rental_duration,
  NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
FROM film_category fc
JOIN category c
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
ORDER BY f.rental_duration ASC;

  Question 3:
Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within
each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:
  Category
  Rental length category
  Count

/* Query 3 - Part 1 */

WITH t1 as (
SELECT
  f.title, c.name , f.rental_duration,
  NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
FROM film_category fc
JOIN category c
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
)

SELECT
  t1.name, t1.standard_quartile,
  COUNT(t1.standard_quartile)
FROM t1
GROUP BY t1.name, t1.standard_quartile
ORDER BY t1.name, t1.standard_quartile ASC;
